**What is List?**
 A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable and allows duplicate members.
 we can add different *data types* like string,tuple,set,dictionary.

 In above program the for loop has the range between 0 to length of the
 given list. The value of a[i] for the current i is multiped by the multiplication
 of previous two digits. for eg. if value of i=0 then a[0]=1 and s=1
 hence b=1*1=1, s=b=1. In the next step i=1 then a[1]=2 and s=1
 hence b=2*1=2, s=2 and so on...
